    <h1> 257 Dryer Struggles! </h1>
    <h2> Part 1 : Preparation</h2> 
    <p> <h3>My Interface : 257 Dryer</h3> </p> 
    <p> <h3>Questions :</h3> 
      <ol>
        <li> Do you use the 257 dryers often? </li>
        <li> Are there any buttons/categories that you don’t really know what it means? </li>
        <li> When you first used the dryer were you able to get hold of it easily? <br>
         Give me a number from 1-5, 1 being super easy and 5 being clueless. </li>
        <li> What are some of the improvements you can make to the dryer?</li>
        <li> What do you think the lock icon is doing?</li>
        <li> Overall, do you think 257 dryers are designed well?</li>
        <li> Are you satisfied with the product of this interface?</li>
        <li> Do you think a 10 year old can use this interface? How about a 70 year old?</li>
      </ol>
       </p> 
      <p><h3>Sketch :</h3> 
      From what you see from the sketch, you would expect that you will be able to make all these controls separately but a <br>
      lot of the times when you select a certain option, the other options get locked. Also some wordings such as “casual”, <br>
      “bulky”, and “options”  are not intuitive and it is hard to figure out what exactly the lock icon is doing. </p>

      <h2> Part 2 : Observation </h2> 
      <p><h3>Key Observations:</h3> 
        <ol>
          <li> They normally don’t know what “bulky” or “casual” are supposed to mean. Many of them associate “casual” to normal <br>
            clothes and get confused on how that is different from the normal mode. </li>
          <li> People often get confused which button to choose to control the chime and wrinkle release options. Do you click <br> 
            “option” or “select”?  </li>
          <li> They also get confused by the lock icon. What is it supposed to lock? Which button do you have to press to lock? <br> 
            Does it lock you options or does it lock the dryer itself (to prevent kids from opening it)? </li> 
          <li> Some of them will not know which settings to put for certain clothes. (ex: What should the temperature be if I want <br> 
            to dry my sweater?) → resort to trial and error </li> 
          <li> People often can’t use this dryer at its full potential (ex: they will assume that they can’t put beddings like pillows <br>
            in the dryer, when they actually can with right settings) </li> 
        </ol>

      <h2> Part 3: Personas </h2>
      <h3>Persona 1: Lazy Larry</h3> 
      <img src="lazy larry.png" alt="lazylarry" style = "width:700px ; height:420px"> <br>
      <strong>Description:</strong> <br>
      Lazy Larry is a typical college student living on his own for the first time. He is used to his mom doing his laundry at home. <br>
      He is a typical user who doesn’t know how to use the dryer and doesn’t feel motivated to look up instructions. <br>
      <strong>Interface Problem:</strong> <br>
      Because the basic setting options are vague and limited, he may end up wasting some of his clothes. Including more settings for delicates, <br>
      beddings, jackets,...etc that are more straightforward and useful will prevent him from drying his clothes in a wrong setting. <br> 
      <strong> Representation: </strong> <br>
      Most people living in 257 are college students. Since 257 is a pretty expensive apartment, students living here most likely come from <br>
      a privileged household where they don’t have to worry about doing these chores. They are prone to all the rookie mistakes (putting colored <br>
       clothes and white clothes in the same cycle) but at the same time they are too lazy or unmotivated to fix those mistakes. <br>

      <h3>Persona 2: Sensitive Susan</h3>
      <img src="sesitive susan.png" alt="sensitivesusan" style = "width:700px ; height:420px"> <br>
      <strong>Description:</strong> <br>
      Sensitive Susan enjoys shopping and cares more about her clothes/looks. She is more organized than lazy Larry and is more sensitive to <br>
      hygiene/cleanliness. She is the type of user who will look at all the options and buttons that the dryer has. <br>
      <strong>Interface Problem:</strong> <br>
      She is the type who would get extremely frustrated by the trial-and-error process. She will not use the basic settings that are in vague <br> 
      languages. She is also frustrated by how she can’t customize the settings as much as she would like. <br>
      <strong> Representation: </strong> <br>
      As mentioned above, 257 will typically have college students from comfortable backgrounds. Sensitive Susan will probably have a few clothes <br>
      that are quite expensive and would want to take good care of it. Since she enjoys shopping (like a typical college student) and decorating her <br> 
      room, she will have different types of clothes that require different dryer settings. <br>
